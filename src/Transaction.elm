{-| This module provides all the tools necessary to create modular components
that manage their own effects. **It is very important that you go through
[this tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-components).** It describes a
pattern that is crucial for any of these functions to make sense.

This is stuff that is used by the `Start` module to actually make things go.
Generally speaking, these are functions you should never use.

-- TRANSACTIONS

type Transaction msg model =
    Transaction (Effect msg) model


done : model -> Transaction msg model
done model =
    Transaction Empty model


requestTask : Task.Task Never msg -> model -> Transaction msg model
requestTask task model =
    Transaction (Task task) model


requestTick : (Float -> msg) -> model -> Transaction msg model
requestTick tagger model =
    Transaction (Tick tagger) model


{-| This lets you request multiple tasks and ticks.
-}
request : Effect msg -> model -> Transaction msg model
request effect model =
    Transaction effect model


-- EFFECTS

{-| Represents some kind of effect. Right now this library supports tasks for
arbitrary effects and clock ticks for animations.
-}
type Effect msg
    = Task (Task.Task Never msg)
    | Tick (Float -> msg)
    | Empty
    | Branch (List (Effect msg))


{-| A type that has no members. There are no values of type `Never`, so if
something has this type, it is a guarantee that it can never happen. It is
useful for demanding that a `Task` can never fail.
-}
type Never = Never Never


{-| Turn a `Task` into an `Effect` that results in a `msg`.

Normally a `Task` has a error type and a success type. In this case the error
type is `Never` meaning that you must provide a task that never fails. Lots of
tasks can fail (like HTTP requests), so you will want to use `Task.toMaybe`
and `Task.toResult` to move potential errors into the success type so they can
be handled explicitly.
-}
task : Task.Task Never msg -> Effect msg
task =
    Task


{-| Request a clock tick for animations. This function takes a function to turn
the current time into a `msg` that can be handled by the relevant component.
-}
tick : (Float -> msg) -> Effect msg
tick =
    Tick


{-| Create a batch of effects. The following example requests two tasks: one
for the userâ€™s picture and one for their age. You could put a bunch more stuff
in that batch if you wanted!

    init : String -> Transaction Message Model
    init userID =
        request (batch [ task (getUserPicture userID), task (getAge userID) ])
          { id = userID
          , picture = Nothing
          , age = Nothing
          }
-}

batch =

map : (a -> b) -> Effect a -> Effect b
map func effect =
  case effect of
    Task task ->
        Task (Task.map func task)

    Tick tagger ->
        Tick (tagger >> func)

    Empty ->
        Empty

    Branch effectList ->
        Branch (List.map (map func) effectList)


-- CHAINING

-- EFFECT INTERPRETER

{-| **Note:** This is a very advanced feature. Unless you are writing a package
for `Transactions` with additional features and want to keep backwards
compatability, you do not need this.

Tear apart a `Transaction` so that you can use this information in other
systems.

    type MyTransaction msg model =
        MyTransaction (MyEffect msg) model

    type MyEffect msg
        = BasicEffect (Effect msg)
        | GraphQL Query
        | ...

    toMyTransaction : Transaction msg model -> MyTransaction msg model
    toMyTransaction transaction =
        let
            {model, effect} = destruct transaction
        in
            MyTransaction (BasicEffect effect) model

Again, this is a very advanced feature. Ask around the Elm community if you are
thinking of using it for some reason.
-}
destruct : Transaction msg model -> { model : model, effect : Effect msg }
destruct (Transaction effect model) =
    { effect = effect
    , model = model
    }


{-| **Note:** This is a very advanced feature. If you are writing normal code
for a project of your own, you almost certainly do not want this. It is meant
to be used with `destruct` to create custom transactions and effect managers.

Convert an `Effect` into a task that cannot fail. When run, the resulting
task will send a bunch of messages to the given `Address`.
